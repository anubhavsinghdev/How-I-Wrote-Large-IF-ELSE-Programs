# Find if Number is Odd or Even

Finally after years of hard work in field of development someone intelligent (me obviously) has written a code that can find whether the number is even or odd.

I know you are thinking if I wrote all 2,00,00 lines of code per language, no I did not, no one is that stupid to write these many lines of code for simple thing.

In simple words I wrote the code that writes the code for this thing.

I just wrote less than 50 line of code for a language, that writes the code of this program.
Checkout what I wrote that created these many lines of codes by itself.
